# AI-Powered-Chatbot-for-Floor-Issue-Reporting
create an AI-powered chatbot that will streamline the process of collecting floor issue details from users. The chatbot should feature AI analysis for assessing the reported issues, provide email recommendations, facilitate Stripe payments, and support calendar bookings for follow-up services. The right candidate will have experience in chatbot development, AI integration, and payment processing.
===============
To build an AI-powered chatbot that collects floor issue details from users, assesses reported issues, provides email recommendations, facilitates Stripe payments, and supports calendar bookings for follow-up services, we will break the process down into several components. Below is an outline and Python code example for such a chatbot.
Key Features:

    Collect Floor Issue Details: The chatbot will prompt users to provide details about floor issues.
    AI Analysis: Analyze the user-provided data to identify the severity of the issue and categorize it.
    Email Recommendations: Based on the analysis, the chatbot will send an email with recommendations to the user.
    Stripe Payment Integration: Facilitate payment for floor repair services through Stripe.
    Calendar Booking: Support calendar booking for follow-up services.

We'll use several Python libraries:

    Flask for creating a web-based chatbot service.
    Dialogflow or Rasa for chatbot AI, as it can process natural language and assess user inputs.
    Stripe for handling payments.
    Google Calendar API or a similar library for managing calendar bookings.
    Flask-Mail for sending emails.

Prerequisites:

    Install required libraries:

    pip install Flask stripe flask-mail rasa dialogflow google-api-python-client

1. Create Flask App (Web framework for the chatbot interface)

This simple Flask app will allow communication between the chatbot, email sending service, Stripe payment integration, and calendar booking system.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, redirect, url_for
import stripe
from flask_mail import Mail, Message
import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

# Setup email configuration
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.gmail.com'
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 465
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your_email@example.com'
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_email_password'
app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = False
app.config['MAIL_USE_SSL'] = True

mail = Mail(app)

# Stripe setup (replace with your keys)
stripe.api_key = "your_stripe_secret_key"

# Example database to store floor issue reports (in-memory for demonstration)
floor_issues_db = []

# Chatbot handling user input and assessment
@app.route('/chatbot', methods=['POST'])
def chatbot():
    user_input = request.json.get("user_input")
    
    # AI analysis of the floor issue (for demonstration, a simple rule-based check)
    issue_type = analyze_issue(user_input)
    
    # Store issue in database (in-memory for now)
    floor_issues_db.append({"user_input": user_input, "issue_type": issue_type, "timestamp": datetime.datetime.now()})
    
    response = {
        "issue_type": issue_type,
        "message": f"Your issue is categorized as: {issue_type}. Would you like to schedule a service?"
    }
    
    return jsonify(response)

def analyze_issue(issue_description):
    # Simple AI analysis logic (replace with actual model or API like DialogFlow)
    if "crack" in issue_description.lower():
        return "Crack in the floor"
    elif "water" in issue_description.lower():
        return "Water damage"
    elif "uneven" in issue_description.lower():
        return "Uneven floor"
    else:
        return "General issue"

# Send email recommendation to the user based on the issue
@app.route('/send_email', methods=['POST'])
def send_email():
    issue_data = request.json
    user_email = issue_data.get("user_email")
    issue_type = issue_data.get("issue_type")
    
    # Email content based on issue type
    subject = "Floor Issue Recommendations"
    body = f"Dear User,\n\nWe have categorized your issue as: {issue_type}. Here are some recommendations:\n- Contact a professional.\n- Prepare the area before service.\n\nThank you for using our service!"
    
    msg = Message(subject, sender='your_email@example.com', recipients=[user_email])
    msg.body = body
    mail.send(msg)
    
    return jsonify({"message": "Email sent successfully."})

# Handle Stripe payment
@app.route('/payment', methods=['POST'])
def payment():
    amount = 1000  # Example amount in cents for a floor service
    stripe_token = request.json.get("stripe_token")
    
    try:
        charge = stripe.Charge.create(
            amount=amount,
            currency="usd",
            description="Floor Repair Service",
            source=stripe_token,
        )
        return jsonify({"message": "Payment successful.", "charge_id": charge.id})
    except stripe.error.StripeError as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)})

# Booking a follow-up service
@app.route('/book_service', methods=['POST'])
def book_service():
    service_data = request.json
    user_email = service_data.get("user_email")
    preferred_date = service_data.get("preferred_date")
    
    # Here you can integrate with Google Calendar API for booking.
    # For demonstration, we'll just confirm the booking.
    return jsonify({
        "message": f"Service booked for {user_email} on {preferred_date}."
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

2. AI Analysis with Rasa/Dialogflow

This basic Flask app contains a function analyze_issue() that classifies the issue into categories like cracks, water damage, or uneven flooring. For more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP), you could integrate Dialogflow or Rasa. Both are platforms that allow you to create a more advanced conversation flow and perform intent detection and entity recognition.

For example, Dialogflow setup:

    Create an agent and define intents like "Crack in the floor," "Water damage," and "Uneven floor."
    Use Dialogflow API to send the user input and get back the analysis result.

3. Stripe Payment Integration

Stripe can handle payments for the floor repair service. The user will send a Stripe token generated from the client-side payment form, and this token is used to charge the user via the Stripe API. The example above demonstrates how to process a Stripe payment.
4. Calendar Booking Integration

For booking follow-up services, you can integrate Google Calendar API. This requires OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google and utilizing the Google Calendar API to schedule events. Here's a simple method that confirms booking but doesn't interact with Google Calendar directly. You could replace this with actual calendar integration.
5. Frontend (Client Side)

You'd typically integrate this Flask backend with a front-end UI where users can chat with the bot, make payments, and schedule follow-up services. Frontend tools such as React, Vue.js, or Angular can help with this.
Summary of Key Functionalities:

    Chatbot powered by AI (e.g., DialogFlow or Rasa) to assess floor issues.
    Email Recommendations for users based on their issue type.
    Stripe Payment integration to process payments for services.
    Calendar Booking for scheduling follow-up services.

Next Steps:

    Deploy the Flask app on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
    Create a user-friendly frontend for interacting with the chatbot.
    Implement more advanced AI models for accurate issue analysis.
    Integrate Google Calendar API to handle bookings seamlessly.

This solution will streamline the process for users to report floor issues, make payments, and schedule follow-up services with ease!
